						    <div class="discr">
								<p>	Cake_VR is a <b>socialVR tool</b>, allowing cake makers and clients to <b>collaboratively design unique cakes remotely in a shared virtual space</b>. It is the Master thesis of Design for Interaction, collaborating with CWI (Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica), national research institute for mathematics and computer science in the Netherlands.

										<p id="right-side"> In this project, I want explore how to <b>integrate co-design methodology to customization services to increase customer participation</b>, and hence, user satisfaction. However, in the current situation, clients communicate about cake design with pastry chefs in face-to-face meeting, followed up by online chat. The current way is insufficient for the users to convey and understand abstract design ideas. Therefore, I think <b>SocialVR is a promising medium to support remote co-design activities</b>, for its interactive 3d visualization and free operation.</p>

							<h2>User research</h2><br><br>
							<div class="row">
								<div class="discr">
									<div class="col-md-4">
										<p>In this research, I wanted to <b> understand the current interaction of the customized cake services </b>. Here, I want to explore two questions. In order to answer these questions, I <b>interview</b> 5 cake makers and 4 clients who have personalized cakes before.</p>

							<div class="row">
								<div class="discr">
									<p>I transcripted the interview audio recordings and collected the relevant quatations. Then, I conducted a thematic analysis by clustering these quatations. After that, I conducted two main categories: (1) Personal experienece of bakers and clients (2) Communication workflow. This information led to two research results.

									<h4>[Result 1] workflow of baker-client communication</h4>
									<div class="imga"> <p> <img src="08/C-05.gif" width="90%"></p> </div>
									<p>The workflow is generally divided into three stages: <b>Giving client input</b> (Custmer convey their intial thoughts to inform the cake design); <b>Ideation & Negotiation</b> (Bakers and customers colloratively develop the cake ideas by negotiation); <b>Agreement</b> (Bakers document the final decisions for reaching an agreement)</p>
									<div class="col-md-4" >
										<button type="button" class="collapsible">[1] CLIENT INPUT</button> 
												<div class="content">
					 							 	<p id="caption"> First, the idea is originated from client inputs. In this phase, client express their ideas to cake maker, based on the emotion they would convey via this cake, or the context in which the cake would be consumed, or, the desired physical features of the cake. When describing their ideas, clients usually utilize a collection reference images to illustrate the abstract thoughts.</p>
												</div>
									</div>
									<div class="col-md-4" >
										<button type="button" class="collapsible">[2] IDEATION & NEGOTIATION</button> 
												<div class="content";>
					 							 	<p id="caption">Second, the cake idea is developed based on the collaborative ideation and negotiation. Cake makers and clients adapt some reference design templates, combine existing design elements, or create something from scratch. They exchange ideas and professional advices, in aid of diverse media, such as dummy, photos and sketch or even real cakes. These media were efficient in presenting tacit information, such as size, 3d shape, aesthetic, which are difficult to express in words. </p>
												</div>
									</div>
									<div class="col-md-4" >
										<button type="button" class="collapsible">[3] AGREEMENT</button> 
												<div class="content">
					 							 	<p id="caption">Third, the client and cake maker reach an agreement on the final decision by making a conclusion. They usually transform all the design details into texts and images, and then documents them into a digital or physical contract, as an evidence of their consensus. </p>
												</div>
									</div>		
								</div>
							</div>

							<br><br><br><br>

							<div class="discr">
								<h4>[Result 2] Concern/Latent needs to Design requirements</h4>
								<p></p>
								<ul>
									<li>There is a lack of integration of multiple media in the design process.</li>
									<li>Participants lack immediate and direct perception of the effects of their design intervention.</li>
									<li>A time-efficient method is needed for cake makers to embody the finalized cake ideas.</li>
									<li>There is a need for presenting the finalized ideas including both vivid details and an overall image.</li>
									<li>Cake makers need a more efficient way to manage the decision information so as to conclude design decisions.</li>
								</ul>
							</div>	

							<div class="discr">
								<p>Based on these results as well as the current state of art in literature, I concluded 10 design requirements of the CakeVR.</p>

							<h2>Design</h2><br><br>
							<div class="discr">
								<p>Based on the design requirements, I drafted the general system of CakeVR. It is a virtual sapce where two users can meet each other represented as cartoonish avatars by wearing HMDs. They can switch the virtual environment between a virtual bakery and an event context where the cake would be consumed. Opertation interfaces were offered for them to do 3d works, and the 3d models will be visualized real-time.</p>
								<div class="imga"> <p> <img src="08/C-34.png" width="70%"></p> </div>
								<p>Also, all the ten design requirement are included in the proposed interaction flow of CakeVR. Here is the video demo in which all of them will be elaborated.</p>

								<div class="discr">
									<div class="col-md-4">
										<p>A dual-user test was performed including one participant (play the role of client) and one researcher (play the role of cake maker).

								<div class="discr">
									
										<p>The procedure of the test is divided into 3 phases. [1] A skype interview is performed one day before the VR test, for inspiring the participants to <b>generate a context</b> for which the cake would be made. The outcome of the interview is a collection of reference images and key words which would present the cake idea. [2] These reference images will be loaded into the VR application for <b>the formal VR co-design sessions</b>.[3] A <b>post-test interview</b> will be performed, and the participants were asked to fill in the System Usability Scale questionnaires (SUS).</p>

							<div class="row">
								<div class="discr">

										<b><p>3. Affective interaction and co-presence</p></b>
										<p>The lack of facial expression and emotional perception in virtual avatar leads to different user experience on participants who have different needs for emotional connection in collaboration,.
