								<p>	Cake_VR is a VR-aided collaboration system, allowing cake makers and clients to collaboratively design unique cakes remotely in a shared virtual space. It is my master thesis project, collaborating with CWI (Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica), the Center of Mathematics and Computer Science in the Netherlands.

									<p> In this project, I want to explore how to integrate co-design methodology to customization services to increase customer participation and user satisfaction. I choose the use case of cake customization of services cuz I am a super fan of desserts and in Delft there are a lot of super nice bakeries for me to immerse in the context. From my initial research, I found that clients communicate about cake design with pastry chefs in face-to-face meetings, followed up by online chat remotely. The current communication way is insufficient for the users to convey and understand abstract design ideas. </p>

										<p>I am wondering, is SocialVR (a multi-user VR space)  a promising tool for people to “bake” cakes together, for its proficient 3d visualization and operation? After that, I built up the research lens of this project, exploring the potential of socialVR for supporting remote co-design practices in the customization retail context.</p>

								<p>Based on the insights above, I came up with 8 design requirements to support the 3 phases of the co-design process. Eash design requirement aims to fix the latent need, deal with the pain points, or facilitate the main action of the co-design activities. These requirements are the main functionality or interaction techniques of CakeVR, they will be incorporated in the system design and storyboard, and implemented in the following process of VR development.</p>

								<p>Based on the design requirements, I drafted the general system of CakeVR. It is a virtual sapce where two users can meet each other represented as cartoonish avatars by wearing HMDs. They can switch the virtual environment between a virtual bakery and an event context where the cake would be consumed. Opertation interfaces were offered for them to do 3d works, and the 3d models will be visualized real-time.</p>

Thus, I try to make it as simple as possible. ‘B’ button is for clicking on all the UI buttons of virtual screens, which already cover most of the functions of CakeVR. ‘A’ button for 3d drawing. The ‘Gripping buttons’ of both hands are used for gripping 3d objects.</p>

I found that among the six customer participants(C5-C10), two of them are “active co-designer” (C6, C9)while the other four are “passive co-designers”(C5,7,8,10). From the “activity pattern”, you can see that active co-designers spent more time in building up and cake while the baker just occasionally gave advice and offered assistance in 3d building. However, the passive co-designers just convey their ideas to bakers and let cake makers build up the cake according to their requirements, generally they spend little time in cake-making.</p>
