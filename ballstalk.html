							Introduction
					</div>

				    <div class="discr">
						<p>Ball & Stalk(Dutch: Bal & Spriet) is a storytelling board game in aid of a mobile application guidance, aiming to lower the threshold of communicating about obesity and weight, and even nudge a dialogue about weight is a positive way.</p>
						<p>This project is The Healthy Storytelling project (2018-2020),  examines how interactive storytelling can contribute to making eHealth accessible to the obesity group with low literacy and how eHealth can be used for obesity prevention. Through a Research-through-Design approach, the research team works closely with obesity patients, medical practitioners and serious game companies and other NGOs.</p>

						Strategy & Design process
					</div>
					<div class="discr">
						<p>The strategy of this project is utilizing true personal stories to generate more storytelling, via an interactive and fun game experience. In this way, we hope that people can reflect on their daily life issues about the obesity stigma, and feel more free and position to talk about weight. Therefore, the whole design process is divided into 3 phases: [1] collect stories, [2] design with stories, [3] generate stories.</p>

							<div class="col-md-6">
								<p> We collect stories about daily events from overweight people. We then tell them anonymously to others to encourage them to tell their story. All those stories put together can cause people to adjust their prejudices and misconceptions. I didn’t actually participate in this part because this session was already complete before I joined this project. </p>

						2. Design with stories
					</div>	

					<div class="work-subtitle-2">
						It is a role play game with storytelling.
					</div>
					<div class="discr">
						<p> We collected the stories, and wanted to utilize them as a catalyst for more open communication and storytelling between people. We think role-play is a good strategy. Therefore, we create two roles: Ball & Stalk. Ball stands for the people in large size while the stalk represents the people with normal weight. In the game, one player plays the role of ball while the other one plays the role of stalk. They will go through the daily life of Ball & Stalk which were adapted from the stories we collected. And then, try to empathize with them.</p>

					<div class="work-subtitle-2">
						It is a board game in aid of a mobile app.
					</div>

					<div class="discr">
						<p>How can we make players go through the stories of Ball & Stalk? The board game aided by a mobile app is an ideal way. The players need to encounter the different scenes of the storyline displayed on the game board. They move forward on the board by throwing the dice on the app and move their token on the board. Yep, similar mechanism with the game Monopoly.</p>

					<div class="discr">
						<div class="row">
							<div class="col-md-7">
								<p><b>Design of Board</b><br>The way we organize the board is contingent on the way we structure the storyline. We referred to the Freytag Pyramid of interactive storytelling, and then build up the storyline, the two roles, get to know, have prejudice, try to reconcile with, and empathize with each other.</p>

						</div>
						<p>As you can see, the storyline divided the whole story game into 3 parts, and this informed our design decisions on the game board. Players can move on the line( yellow for Ball and green for Stalk), and come across different daily life scenes, and hence, experience the life and thoughts of the role which he/she played.</p>

Players need to make their choices by clicking the options, and at the same time, explain the thoughts behind their choices.</p>

They roll the dice, move around the board together, get new game stories and make choices in the dilemma. But players who play the role of ball and stalk should make choices separately and secretly. After that, their answers will be shown on the app. If they make the same choices, they can go ahead on the storyline, if not, they need to go back to the place where they start from. Finally, they finish all of the three parts and reach the final end.</p>

								<h1>Usability</h1>
								<p>* The <b>general usability of this game is good</b>. We found that 16 out of 19 participants gave a score more than 4 (the 5-point system).<br><br> * The app is <b>easy to use for people who are unfamiliar with digital user interface</b>. The age of the participants ranged from 10 to 70, but we didn’t find a significant correlation between the usability score and age.</p>

							<div class="col-md-4">
								<div class="insight">
								<h1>Experience</h1>
								<p>* <b>Incentive mechanism</b> of the game should be improved. <br><br>* <b>Four-player setting (2 players for one role)</b> is the best for the game engagement.</p>
								</div>
							</div>
							<div class="col-md-4">
								<div class="insight">
								<h1>Effect</h1>
								<p>* The game really <b>helped raise the awareness of weighty stigma in daily life</b>, from the questionnaire results. <br><br>* The game <b>didn’t help to lower the threshold of talking about weight</b>. Because this could be a long-term effect which could not be instantly evaluated right after game play, and we put more focus on how to deal with prejudice when designing stories.</p>
