								Introduction
							</div>

						    <div class="discr">
								<p>	Ultimaker 3D printers are mostly used for prototyping models on the carpet floor like fab labs or design offices. Now, Ultimaker is expanding its business area to the concrete floor like production lines in factories. In this project, we are <b> redesigning the 3D printers managing system for factory manufacture.</b></p>

								<div class="imga"><p><img  src="04/designprocess.png" width="90%"></p></div>
								
								<p> <b>My task:</b>In this project, I was mainly responsible for (1) conducting desktop resarch, (2) concluding design goal and deisgn requirments, (3) building up user interface with Adobe XD, (4) doing quatitiative analysis of user test results, (5) editting video for showcase.</p>

								Research
							</div>

							<div class="discr">
								<p> In the initial research, we did desktop research and interviews to <b>(1)build up the persona of the targeted group,</b> as well as <b>(2)analyze the existing problems of the current Ultimaker software system.</b></p>

									<div class ="col-md-7">
										<p> In this project, we aim to design a managing software system for 3D printer operators working in manufacturer factories. The challenge of the user research is that we cannot really get access to the real 3d printer operator, at least in the Netherlands. Because this occupation might not exist yet. Thus, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 3d printer technologists or makers in the university or design company, and did desktop research by watching videos of some existing 3d printing factories outside the Netherlands on Youtube. Then, we got some useful insights about how the 3d printer operators work.</p>

									<p><b>Insight1. The overlaying product ecosystem structure</b><br>Cura, Cura Connect, Ultimaker printers and Ultimaker app are all relevant products relevant to printing process, developed by Ultimaker. They share similar names, different 'locations' (on the user's computer, the Ultimakers themselves and the user's phone, respectively) and overlapping functionalities. This easily cause confusion for user to choose the right tool for a specific task. Ideally, this distinction does not matter to the user, to make sure the whole process of printing job is a fluent process.

								<button type="button" class="collapsible">2 Conceps & Comparative study</button> 
									<div class="content">
													<h2> Initial Concept</h2>

													
													<p id="caption"> We decided to design two concepts: one focused on a desktop
														interface and the other focused on a mobile phone interface. They
														mostly differ in ways of giving the operators a feeling of control.
														On the desktop, we assumed, they have more control, because
														they have more overview on a bigger screen. On the phone, we
														assumed, they have control because they will be able to change
														settings and abort a print whenever and wherever they are. </p>
													
													<p id="caption"> In order to efficiently develop the concept and gain more insight, we choose one essential part of printing process and develop prototype. This part is "seleting and grouping available 3D printers". This agile development enable us to quickly do concept test and iterate. </p>
													
													<div class="imga"> <p> <img src="04/process.gif" width="70%"></p> </div>

													<h4> Concept#1 - Desktop </h4>

													<div class="imga"><p> <img src=04/desk1.png width="30%"> <img src=04/desk2.png width="30%"></p> <p>Interface</p></div>
													<div class="imga"><p> <img src=04/story1.gif width="70%"> </p> <p>Scenario</p></div>

													
													<p id="caption"> "Group Overview" & "Printer Overview", these two main tabs are set for users fluently switch between production line and individual group. Additionally, an extra filter tab enable users to filter the list of printers based on the
															configurations they are looking for. The filter
															function can also be used when grouping the printers. The grouping
															is done by clicking "make new group"selecting the right
															printers and then clicking "group". </p> 
													

													<h4> Concept#2 - Mobile </h4>
													<div class="imga"><p> <img src=04/mobile2.png width="15%"> <img src=04/mobile.png width="15%"></p> <p>Interface</p></div>
													<div class="imga"><p> <img src=04/story2.gif width="70%"> </p> <p>Scenario</p></div>

													<p id="caption">The app is designed in such a way that you could use it to
														scan printers to group them, instead of having to select them
														on-screen. This way, users can physically see the
														printers they are grouping and the printers can give immediate
														feedback. Furthermore, the app could be used to get notifications
														of maintenance and/or faulty prints, so the operator can abort the
														print anywhere if necessary. </p> 
													

													<hr>

													<h2> Comparative Concept Test</h2>

													
														<p id="caption">To compare two concepts and look for the gap between our understanding in context and our ideas, we conducted a comparative concept test. Via this test, we find out pros and cons of both concepts and explore essential design elements which are relevant to our proposed user experience.</p>

													

													<h4> Research Question </h4>
														<ul>
															<li>What are the pros and cons of both concepts?</li>
															<li> How are they relavent to design goal: Efficiency and Feel of Control?</li>
														</ul>
												

													<h4> Test Method </h4>
														<p id="caption"> We use paper prototype of interface and Ultimaker printers for this test. During test, we let participants to experience the context by explaining the storyboard and interact with the mock-up. Then, they were asked to perform a specific task: Create a printer group. In this process, we made video and audio recording for qualitative data, also, we user word clouds and System Usability scale for quantitative data. </p>

														<div class="imga"> <p> <img src="04/test.gif" width="70%"></p> </div>

													<h4> Conclusion </h4>

														<p id="caption">In conclusion, participants prefer desktop model for its <b>efficiency and clear overview</b>. On the other hand, mobile interaction is preffered because participants can control printers <b>anywhere and anytime</b>, also they like seeing <b>direct feedback of user impact</b> from physicial printers.</p>

														<div class="imga"> <p> <img src="04/concept-result.gif" width="100%"></p> </div>

								<p><b>Keeping track of which printer group is printing which model in what status, is one of the main tasks of the future operator.</b> Therefore, we decided to make the schedule the main screen of the application. To make sure the users recognize it as a schedule, similar use cues as existing calendar and scheduling applications were used. Then we draft a structure of the schedule, an X-Y axis coordination system, the x-axis presents the time while the y-axis shows the printer. It indicates information needed to be able to identify a job: <b>(1) which printer, (2) how many printers,(3) how much time, are devoted to (4) which printing job.</b></p>

								<p>These errors were categorized into four levels: 'first try', 'second try', 'third try or more', and 'guidance needed to finish task'. We made an overview of the error occurrence of every single step of the three tasks. Since participants of the four tests differentiated a lot in knowledge about 3D printers and digital interface, we found that the test results were non-consistent. But we still managed to conclude useful insights.</p>

								<p>Finally, we prioritized the 10 usability problems based on the severity and frequency and put them in a graph. With severity, we mean the level of the negative impact the problem has on being able to successfully finish a task. With frequency, we mean the number of times the user comes across the task in their daily work. Based on the frequency-severity graph, <b>we made an ordered list of the usability problems that need solving.</b></p>
