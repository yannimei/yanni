							<h2 >Introduction</h2>

						    <div class="discr">
								<p>	Ultimaker 3D printers are mostly used for prototyping models on the carpet floor like fab labs or design offices. Now, Ultimaker is expanding its business area to the concrete floor like production lines in factories. In this project, we are <b> redesigning the 3D printers managing system for factory manufacture.</b>
								</p>

							</div>

							<h2 >Vision & Design</h2>

								<h4>Vision Senario & Interaction</h4>
								<p><iframe width="750" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/abDWVI2FzjM" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe> </p>

								<div class="imga"><p><img  src="04/2_Design-Overview5.gif" width="70%" ></p></div>

								<br><br>

							<hr>
							<h2 >Context</h2>
							<div class="discr">
							<p> The context we focused on is <b>Concrete Floor</b>, consisting of manufacturer factories with larger amounts of printers, which are used for production, manufacturing purposes. In this context, <b>10 to 40 printers</b> should be managed by several operators. </p>
							</div>
							<p><img src="04/context.gif" width="50%"></p> <br>

							<h2 >Target Group</h2>
							<div class="discr">
								<p> The target group in this project is 3D printing operators.  
									Their task is making a printer fleet run smoothly and efficiently. Usually they get 3d model files from designers and engineers, and assign printing jobs to printers. Their job includes doing basic physical maintanence, switching printing material filaments, etc.</p>
							</div>

							<p><img src="04/target1.gif" width="80%"></p> <br>

							<div class="discr">
								<p> Besides 3d printers, they are also in charge of other production machines such as CNC millers. Thus, they need to move around the whole factory floor, between 3d printers, different machines and desktop.
								</p>
							</div>
							<p><img src="04/target2.gif" width="30%"></p> <br>

							<p>In conclusion, <b>Flexibility</b> and <b>Mobility</b> essential priority for them.</p>

							<hr>
							<h2 >Initial research</h2>

							<div class="discr">
							<p> Based on the <b>interviews </b> and <b>user inspections</b> of the analysis
								phase of this project, we gathered a list of
								interactions and experience problems that we summarized in 3
								main painpoints: </p>
							</div>

								<h4>[1] The overlaying product ecosystem structure </h4> 
								<div class="imga"><p><img src="04/overlap.gif" width=60%></p> <p>Ultimake Product Ecosystem</p></div>
								<div class="discr">
									<p>Cura, Cura Connect, Ultimaker printers and Ultimaker app are all relevant products relevant to printing process, developed by Ultimaker. They share similar names, different 'locations' (on the user's computer, the Ultimakers themselves and the user's phone, respectively) and overlapping functionalities. This easily cause confusion for user to choose the right tool for a specific task. Ideally, this distinction does not matter to the user, to make sure the whole process of printing job is a fluent process.
									</p>
								</div>
								

								<h4>[2] Insufficient depth of feedback</h4>
								<div class="discr">
									<p>Ultimaker has its own desktop printing management software: Cura Connect. Also, they develop Ultimaker app for same function. However, this products over-simplify the printing process and give <b>too few details and notifications</b> when problems occur. Ideally, the products provide enough information for people to solve problems and take over control without having to consult the manual or online resources. </p>
								</div>
								
								<h4>[3] The large quantities of printers</h4>

								<div class="discr">
									<p> The current print job management interface is currently designed for only a small amount of printers. With more than about ten printers, it becomes <b> harder to find and manage the right printer and print jobs.</b> Ideally, the user can find the printer immediately.</p> 
								</div>

								</div class="row">
									<div class="imga">
										<div class="col-md-1"></div>
										<div class="col-md-5"><p><img src="04/Product-build-up-05.gif" width="100%"></p> <p>Current Desktop Interface </p> </div>
										<div class="col-md-5"><p><img src="04/Product-build-up-06.gif" width="80%"> </p><p> <p>Current Mobile Interface </p> </p></div>
										<div class="col-md-1"></div>
									</div>
								</div>

								<br>
								<p>These problems were the base to create
								the following design goal.</p>

							<hr>

							<h2 >Design Goal</h2><br>
							<p id="designGoal">	Let operators <b>efficiently</b> manage a fleet of 3D printers <br> with a <b>feeling of control</b> in factory workshops.</p>

							<hr>


							<h2>Design exploration - Concept divergence</h2>

							<br><br>
							<div class="discr">
								<button type="button" class="collapsible">2 Conceps & Comparative study</button> 
									<div class="content">
													<h2> Initial Concept</h2>

													
													<p id="caption"> We decided to design two concepts: one focused on a desktop
														interface and the other focused on a mobile phone interface. They
														mostly differ in ways of giving the operators a feeling of control.
														On the desktop, we assumed, they have more control, because
														they have more overview on a bigger screen. On the phone, we
														assumed, they have control because they will be able to change
														settings and abort a print whenever and wherever they are. </p>
													
													<p id="caption"> In order to efficiently develop the concept and gain more insight, we choose one essential part of printing process and develop prototype. This part is "seleting and grouping available 3D printers". This agile development enable us to quickly do concept test and iterate. </p>
													
													<div class="imga"> <p> <img src="04/process.gif" width="70%"></p> </div>

													<h4> Concept#1 - Desktop </h4>

													<div class="imga"><p> <img src=04/desk1.png width="30%"> <img src=04/desk2.png width="30%"></p> <p>Interface</p></div>
													<div class="imga"><p> <img src=04/story1.gif width="70%"> </p> <p>Scenario</p></div>

													
													<p id="caption"> "Group Overview" & "Printer Overview", these two main tabs are set for users fluently switch between production line and individual group. Additionally, an extra filter tab enable users to filter the list of printers based on the
															configurations they are looking for. The filter
															function can also be used when grouping the printers. The grouping
															is done by clicking "make new group"selecting the right
															printers and then clicking "group". </p> 
													

													<h4> Concept#2 - Mobile </h4>
													<div class="imga"><p> <img src=04/mobile2.png width="15%"> <img src=04/mobile.png width="15%"></p> <p>Interface</p></div>
													<div class="imga"><p> <img src=04/story2.gif width="70%"> </p> <p>Scenario</p></div>

													<p id="caption">The app is designed in such a way that you could use it to
														scan printers to group them, instead of having to select them
														on-screen. This way, users can physically see the
														printers they are grouping and the printers can give immediate
														feedback. Furthermore, the app could be used to get notifications
														of maintenance and/or faulty prints, so the operator can abort the
														print anywhere if necessary. </p> 
													

													<hr>

													<h2> Comparative Concept Test</h2>

													
														<p id="caption">To compare two concepts and look for the gap between our understanding in context and our ideas, we conducted a comparative concept test. Via this test, we find out pros and cons of both concepts and explore essential design elements which are relevant to our proposed user experience.</p>

													

													<h4> Research Question </h4>
														<ul>
															<li>What are the pros and cons of both concepts?</li>
															<li> How are they relavent to design goal: Efficiency and Feel of Control?</li>
														</ul>
												

													<h4> Test Method </h4>
														<p id="caption"> We use paper prototype of interface and Ultimaker printers for this test. During test, we let participants to experience the context by explaining the storyboard and interact with the mock-up. Then, they were asked to perform a specific task: Create a printer group. In this process, we made video and audio recording for qualitative data, also, we user word clouds and System Usability scale for quantitative data. </p>

														<div class="imga"> <p> <img src="04/test.gif" width="70%"></p> </div>

													<h4> Conclusion </h4>

														<p id="caption">In conclusion, participants prefer desktop model for its <b>efficiency and clear overview</b>. On the other hand, mobile interaction is preffered because participants can control printers <b>anywhere and anytime</b>, also they like seeing <b>direct feedback of user impact</b> from physicial printers.</p>

														<div class="imga"> <p> <img src="04/concept-result.gif" width="100%"></p> </div>
												
									</div>

									<br><br>

									<p>In this phase, we explore the design ideas by generating two design concepts, and performed a comparative study. The aim of this exploration is to concluding the requirements and insights for the final design decisions.</p>



							</div>

							
							
							<hr>

							<h2> Essential Design Decision</h2>
								<div class="discr">
									<p>From concept comparative test and more research, most important decisions are made, which are highly relevant to our final design.</p>
								</div>
							<h4>Tablet Application</h4>
								<div class="discr">
									<p>Based on conclusion of comparative test, <b> mobility </b>and <b>clear overview </b> are two significant requirement in this context. Thus, a mobile application more fit this scenario. In that case, we need to move part of desktop functionalities (e.g. the print schedule) to
									the mobile application. This meant that a bigger screen is required. To keep an overview of the amount of necessary
									information, while keeping the functionality of a mobile device,
									we decided to design the app for a tablet. According to Ultimaker,
									a significant amount of companies already use company tablets
									in the operation of factory machines. Therefore, it is a reasonable
									medium to base our design on.</p>
								</div>

								<div class="imga">
									<p><img src="04/tablet.gif" width="80%"></p>
								</div>

								<div class="discr">
									<p>Thus, a new product is lauched: "Cura flow". Also, this decision lead to a new simplified ecosystem overview.</p>
								</div>

								<p><img id="image" src="04/after.gif" width="60%"></p>

								<p><button class="change" id="btn-c"  onclick="change()">Check Previous Ecosystem</button>
								

							<h4>Schedule-based Interface + Color-coded Task List</h4>
							<div class="discr">
								<p>Keeping track of what the printers are
									doing, is one of the main tasks of the
									future operator. Therefore, we made
									the schedule the main screen of the
									application. To make sure the users
									recognize it as a schedule, similar use
									cues as existing calendar and scheduling
									applications were used.
									Furthermore, we only showed information
									needed to be able to identify a job.</p>
								<div class="imga"><img src="04/schedule.gif" width="90%"> <p>Main Schedule Interface</p>
								</div>	
								<br><br><br><p>Additionally, keeping track of everything need to be done is an important requirement of operators. Hence, a clear tasklist with color coding is added.</p>
								<div class="imga"><img src="04/tasklist.gif" width="90%"> <p>Task List</p>
								</div>
							</div>
							<hr>

							<h2 >Usability Test</h2>
							<div class="discr">
								<p> In usability test, To test the usability and qualities of our concept, we went to a few companies to test our prototype with operators in real context of factory workshop. In this text, we raised following research questions:</p>

								<ul>	
									<li> Which interaction element impede people from finishing task? How serious is it? </li>
									<li> Which interaction element should be priorited for better experience? </li>
									<li> Do the people feel like the product matches the context they work in?</li>
								</ul>



								<h4> Method </h4>
								<p> This time, digital prototype and carboard 3D printer are utilized in this test. Participanted were show 3d printing video to get more enriched experience, and then were asked to perform three tasks: (1) create a new production line (2) take out finished model (3) fix error of printer (clogged nozzle).</p>

								<div class="imga">
									<p><img src="04/usability-test.png" width="80%"></p>
									<p>Test in factory workshop</p> 
								</div>
							</div>

								<h4> Analysis (Qualitative)</h4>

							<div class="discr">
								<p>  For qualitative data, we collected relevant quotes from the audio recordings. When we were not sure what the participant was talking about or whether they were completely open and honest, we checked the notes on body language and actions, and the video recordings. We cluster them based on its relevance between each other and figure out more deep and abstract meaning behind the quotes.</p>
								<div class="imga">
									<p><img src="04/cluster.gif" width="25%"></p>
									<p >Analysing relevant quotes</p>
								</div>
								<p> Then the quoted were divided into 3 categories. What we more focused on is the 10 usability problems. </p>
								<div class="imga">
									<p><img src="04/qualitative.gif" width="90%"></p>
									<p >Qualitative results</p>
								</div>

							</div>


								<h4> Analysis (Quantitative)</h4>

							<div class="discr">
								<p> For quantified analysis, we focus on error rate data. We checked the prototype screen recordings for usage patterns and collected all the error interactions in every step of each task. </p>
							</div>

							<div class="margin" >
								<div class="col-md-4"  height="300px">
									<p><img src="04/q1.gif" width="60%"></p>
									<p>1. <b>Data collection</b> about<br> usage pattern while testing</p>
								</div>
								<div class="col-md-4"  height="300px">
									<p><img src="04/q2.gif" width="90%"></p>
									<p>2. <b>Collect errors</b> on interface</p>
								</div>
								<div class="col-md-4"  height="300px">
									<p><img src="04/q3.gif" width="80%" ></p>
									<p>3. <b>Categorize</b> the errors and <br> <b>count</b> times of try for the task completion</p>
								</div>
							</div>
							<br><br>
					

							<div class="discr">
								<p> These errors were categorized into four levels: 'first try', 'second try', 'third try or more', and 'guidance needed to finish task'. We made an overview of the error occurrence of every single step of the three tasks. Since participants of the four tests differentiated a lot in knowledge about 3D printers and digital interface, we found that the test results were non-consistent. But we still managed to conclude useful insights. </p>
								<div class="imga">
									<p><img src="04/quantitative.gif" width="80%"></p>
									<p>Qualitative Analysis Result</p>
								</div>

								<h4> Result </h4>
								<p>Finally, we prioritized the 10 usability problems based on the severity and frequency and put them in a graph. With severity, we mean the level of the negative impact the problem has on being able to successfully finish a task. With frequency, we mean the number of times the user comes across the task in their daily work. Based on the frequency-severity graph, we made an ordered list of the usability problems that need solving. </p>
